version of working-on-the-side

This 'problem' STOPS programmes.

so......

run on the side!

take a look at THIS::

	zdb_check.c


you will see 

execv("./zdb_basement",argv1);

execv would normally 'hang up' the programme.
Here, we give it its 'own slot':

   pid_t pid=fork();
   if (pid==0) { /* child process */
	/*
	stuff stuff stuff stuff stuff stuff stuff stuff stuff stuff stuff stuff stuff 

	example of stoppy thing:
		execv("./zdb_basement",argv1);
	stuff stuff stuff stuff stuff stuff stuff stuff stuff stuff stuff stuff stuff 
	*/
        printf("%s\n","maybe captured here.");
    }
    else { /* pid!=0; parent process */
        waitpid(pid,0,0); /* wait for child to exit */
    }
    printf("%s\n","You Escaped!");

"You Escaped!" will show!
