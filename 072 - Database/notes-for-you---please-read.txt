what is this?

A system with 2 programmes.

0.

IN THIS DIRECTORY, we have:

1 + 1.c --- new SQL-handling programme on Sqlite

check + check.c  --- little test programme to 'practice'

notes-for-you....  This!!

what-to-do.txt -- old text file.

test.db  --- SQLite database file

zoe_data.txt --- small text data, to work around the fact that 
                 there is no Return is available from execv

1.

check.c

The part that will be 'incorporated' into the Big programme.



2.

1.c

The part which will be 'independant', and 'called' by the first.

THIS is the one which works with SQLinte,

retrurnd results

which are of the:

1:one;2:two;3:three; variety.

NOTE THAT:
*It does SQL stuff by-itself



1b.

i. Compiling

gcc check.c -o check
(compile check.c to check, which is executable)

ii/ Executing

./check

This RUNS ./1 , and, in the future may be able to accept a returned result.



2b.
Running the 'idependent' programme:

i. Compiling

gcc 1.c -o 1 -lsqlite3


ii. Executing

./1 "SELECT * from testtable where id <> 2"

(the programme [./1] accepts a string with SQL in it.

The results are displayed on screen.


STATE OF PLAY

1. Does add new records.

2. Will 'run' SQL to Extract, but execv will not return.

WE ARE GETTING AROUND THIS BY:

Writing the results into the file zoedata.txt

THIS NEEDS TO BE EMBETTERED IN THE FUTURE....
